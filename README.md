# Multi-Armed-Bandit-Franklin-Li

• Used pandas to clean, filter, and segment synthetic data from CSV file, define variant conditions, and
structure summary statistics, such as average and total playtime across multiple conditions

• Leveraged numpy to simulate stochastic variation in user playtime, perform probabilistic sampling from
Beta distributions for Thompson sampling, and compute allocation portions and statistical metrics during
iteration cycles

• Utilized matplotlib.pyplot to visualize adaptive learning dynamics through line charts and annotated plots,
displaying per-iteration playtime trends and sample allocation changes across experimental arms
